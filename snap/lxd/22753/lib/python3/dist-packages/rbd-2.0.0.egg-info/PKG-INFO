Description: This package contains Python bindings for interacting with the RADOS Block Device (RBD) library. rbd is a utility for manipulating rados block device images, used by the Linux rbd driver and the rbd storage driver for QEMU/KVM. RBD images are simple block devices that are striped over objects and stored in a RADOS object store. The size of the objects the image is striped over must be a power of two.
